**Predicting Prediabetes Risk Using Machine Learning in Bangladesh**

**Background**

Prediabetes is a clinical condition that serves as a critical warning sign for the development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). It is characterized by blood glucose levels that are elevated above the normal range but remain below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, and it poses a growing public health concern. In Bangladesh, the increasing prevalence of prediabetes is driven by a convergence of risk factors, including rapid urbanization, poor dietary habits, sedentary lifestyles, and limited access to preventive healthcare services. Despite the clinical importance of early identification, routine screening for prediabetes remains inadequate, particularly in rural and resource-constrained settings. Traditional statistical models used for risk stratification often fail to capture the complex, non-linear interactions among demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables.

Considering these limitations, the primary objective of this study is to employ machine learning-based predictive models to assess individual risk of prediabetes in the Bangladeshi population, with a strong emphasis on model interpretability through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. While predictive modeling remains central to the study, a key focus lies in understanding and explaining the contribution of individual features to the modelâ€™s output. By employing SHAP, we aim to generate interpretable and transparent models that not only achieve high classification performance but also provide actionable insights into the most influential risk factors associated with prediabetes.
In the context of Bangladeshâ€”where variability in healthcare access, health awareness, and exposure to risk factors is substantialâ€”such explainable machine learning approaches have the potential to inform clinicians, public health experts, and policymakers. The ultimate goal is to enable accurate, interpretable, and context-specific risk prediction using machine learning, thereby supporting equitable strategies for early detection and targeted prevention of prediabetes in Bangladesh.
